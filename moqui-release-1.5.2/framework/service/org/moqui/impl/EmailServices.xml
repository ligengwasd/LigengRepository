        <description>
            Poll an email server (IMAP or POP3) to receive messages. Each new message is processed using
            the Email-ECA rules. Messages are flagged as seen (if supported). Messages are deleted if the storeDelete
            flag is set on the moqui.basic.email.EmailServer record.

            This is meant to be called as a scheduled service, run as often as you want to poll for new messages on a
            particular server (configured in the corresponding moqui.basic.email.EmailServer record).
